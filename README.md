Check-response
===============

PHP-Javascript system to check http server response.

For each request you get all response (headers and optionally the content) displayed in browser console and the basic information - status, time, date, content-type, length, expires, server and content - in html table.

There is a scoreboard that shows the number of requests, percentage of success, counter of system and user-defined errors and response time average.

Single mode at index.html and splitted mode at mult.html.

## Set up:

* Interval between requests
* Fetch content or just headers
* User-Agent
* Keep-Alive
* Cookie
* Accept-Encoding
* Accept-Charset
* Accept-Language
